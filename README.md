WHAT IS PHISHING?![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d33ed92-3995-4e09-9063-ddc60264429a)
Phishing is a type of social engineering where attackers try to trick people into revealing sensitive information like passwords, credits card details, or personal data. They often use fake emails, messages, or websites that appear legitimate.

HOW TO RECOGNISE PHISHING ATTACKS![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfc8f8eb-7a89-412e-b573-153159418ec1)
Suspicious Sender: Check the sender's email address closely. Scammers often use addresses that look similar to legitimate ones but have slight variations.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9aa7c85e-fc5e-4841-97f2-cf32c1c74045)
Urgency & Fear Tactics: Phishing emails often create a sense of urgency, claiming your account is compromised or requiring immediate action. Check the image in the next slide.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1410c43b-2127-4603-aa6f-21f0d0541152)
Generic Greetings: If an email starts with "Dear Customer" instead of using your name, it may be suspicious.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18b340a3-24c4-4b8a-aa54-7ffc32aaa2c1)
Poor Grammar & Spelling: Legitimate organisations proofread their communications. Errors can be a sign of a scam.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a06115a4-75fe-4a4e-be13-a8decb1af330)
Unexpected Links or Attachments: Don't click links or download attachments from unknown sources—they might contain malware.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c692082-9c0d-40aa-9782-6d2ad7907db3)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d59d9a68-775c-4021-ac04-6f1e1a14f6b8)
Requests for Sensitive Information: No reputable company will ask for your password, payment details, or personal information via email.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db55b321-502a-4689-807d-38d82bc50697)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78996c8d-b4f7-4443-8105-d8c11c10cc88)
Look at the URL: Fake websites often use slightly altered domain names (e.g., "microsotf.com" instead of "microsoft.com").
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b991dc9d-74f0-43ed-8d85-b7049bb3f4c0)
Check for HTTPS: Secure sites have "https://" in the address bar. If a website lacks this or has a strange certificate warning, avoid it.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/addde8df-256e-4e24-a721-ffbb28e39eae)
Poor Design & Low-Quality Content: Many fake sites have low-resolution images, bad formatting, or broken links.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f045756-11b3-4819-911c-41521c0b8f3c)
Unexpected Pop-ups & Ads: Fake websites often display intrusive pop-ups that request personal information or prompt downloads.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04296eed-5b52-41d1-82f0-4bd82752e0d5)
No Contact Information: Legitimate businesses provide contact details like phone numbers and physical addresses.

WHAT IS SOCIAL ENGINEERING?![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adb2ebca-832a-4c11-a5d7-04624cbe36c2)
Social engineering is a deceptive strategy that attackers use to manipulate individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. Instead of hacking systems directly, they exploit human psychology.

SOCIAL ENGINEERING TACTICS USED BY ATTACKERS![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f6f7086-08e5-4b00-bec8-bd97b587617c)
Phishing
Attackers send fraudulent emails or messages pretending to be trustworthy sources (banks, tech support, colleagues).
They trick victims into clicking malicious links, downloading malware, or providing personal details.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4736e761-4fe5-4f91-a057-76fbb24f776a)
Pretexting
This involves creating a fabricated scenario to gain trust.
Attackers impersonate authority figures (police, IT staff, or executives) to extract confidential data.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5979619d-db2f-45ad-9085-a683ebad11ba)
Baiting
Offers something enticing, like free downloads or giveaways, to lure victims into compromising their security.
Malicious files disguised as software updates or tempting rewards often contain malware.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfb91c2b-b806-4b40-ba5e-6a9e280bfd40)
Tailgating (Piggybacking)
Attackers gain physical access to restricted areas by closely following authorised personnel.
They may pretend to have forgotten their access card or engage in friendly conversation to slip in unnoticed.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47c69ca5-170d-4945-9b74-a44f501e42c8)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2794fc38-46c5-4ed8-bbdb-c446c283933e)
Quid Pro Quo
Scammers offer fake services or help (e.g., IT support) in exchange for access to systems or information.
Victims unknowingly hand over credentials or sensitive data.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/001522ae-6695-43f8-867f-0e60bbf6f0d4)
Impersonation & Vishing (Voice Phishing)
Attackers call individuals pretending to be a trusted contact, like a bank representative or tech support.
They manipulate victims into disclosing passwords or financial details over the phone.

BEST PRACTICES AND TIPS TO AVOID FALLING VICTIM. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baeaf765-e0fb-42a3-9fad-d115b3b442dc)
Staying safe from phishing attacks and social engineering requires vigilance and smart security habits. Next are some best practices to help you avoid falling victim:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81aa82ec-08b2-4564-9212-26dd953854e0)

Strengthen Your Cyber Hygiene
Use Strong, Unique Passwords: Avoid common phrases. Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. [e.g. (0bib@)2deW$r1d]
Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Adds an extra layer of security, making it harder for attackers to gain access.[e.g Fingerprint, facial ID or SMS token]
Keep Software & Systems Updated: Security patches protect against vulnerabilities exploited by hackers.
Install & Maintain Antivirus Software: Reliable security tools detect and prevent threats.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/797f7059-8f6b-435f-96ef-d4cf47cbe6a8)

2. Stay Alert & Think Before Acting
Verify Requests for Sensitive Information: Don’t share personal details unless you're 100% sure of the source.
Avoid Clicking Suspicious Links or Attachments: Always hover over links to check the real destination.
Double-Check Email Senders: Attackers often use slight variations of legitimate addresses.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a243959c-6652-432f-b301-1df1838a3d32)

3. Secure Your Online Presence
Limit What You Share Publicly: Avoid revealing personal details on social media that could be used against you.
Be Cautious with Free Offers: Baiting tactics often disguise malware as freebies or enticing downloads.
Use Encrypted Communication: Prefer secure messaging platforms for sensitive discussions.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a357feba-d7d7-4387-91cd-0221a4d8aa49)

4. Train Yourself & Others
Educate Family & Friends: Cybersecurity awareness helps prevent scams from succeeding.
Practice recognising scams: Test yourself by reviewing common phishing attempts or fake websites.
Report Suspicious Activities: If you encounter potential threats, notify the IT security teams or authorities.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00b2c8ce-8a3f-42d3-95b9-b1fa0cb851d8)

5. Verify Everything!
When in doubt, contact organisations directly instead of clicking links in unexpected emails.
Don’t trust urgent threats demanding quick action-real companies will give you time to verify issues.
Be sceptical of random requests for login credentials, money, or confidential information. Cybercriminals exploit human emotions like fear, trust, and urgency. Stay calm, think critically, and always verify before acting.
