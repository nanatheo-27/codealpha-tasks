WHAT IS PHISHING?![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d33ed92-3995-4e09-9063-ddc60264429a)
Phishing is a type of social engineering where attackers try to trick people into revealing sensitive information like passwords, credits card details, or personal data. They often use fake emails, messages, or websites that appear legitimate.

Suspicious Sender: Check the sender's email address closely. Scammers often use addresses that look similar to legitimate ones but have slight variations.

Generic Greetings: If an email starts with "Dear Customer" instead of using your name, it may be suspicious.

Poor Grammar & Spelling: Legitimate organisations proofread their communications. Errors can be a sign of a scam.

Unexpected Links or Attachments: Don't click links or download attachments from unknown sources—they might contain malware.

Look at the URL: Fake websites often use slightly altered domain names (e.g., "microsotf.com" instead of "microsoft.com").

Check for HTTPS: Secure sites have "https://" in the address bar. If a website lacks this or has a strange certificate warning, avoid it.

Poor Design & Low-Quality Content: Many fake sites have low-resolution images, bad formatting, or broken links.

Unexpected Pop-ups & Ads: Fake websites often display intrusive pop-ups that request personal information or prompt downloads.

No Contact Information: Legitimate businesses provide contact details like phone numbers and physical addresses.

WHAT IS SOCIAL ENGINEERING?![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adb2ebca-832a-4c11-a5d7-04624cbe36c2)
Social engineering is a deceptive strategy that attackers use to manipulate individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. Instead of hacking systems directly, they exploit human psychology.
